Media
-----

ViciBox supports installation from a USB drive as well as a CD/DVD drive. This is provided through an ISO file that can be used for either installation method. A ISO to USB writer like Rufus can be used to create the installation thumb drive.

There are two different installation medias. The 'Standard' and the 'MultiDrive' version. The standard version is for installation onto a standard drive. If you only have a single drive in the system or are using a hardware RAID controller like an LSI or Adaptec card then you will want to use the standard install media. The 'MD' or MultiDrive media installs in a way that allows two separate drives to be used together in a software RAID1. The two drives used for an MD RAID1 should be the same size and type for best performance.
