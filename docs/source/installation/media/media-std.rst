Standard ISO
============
:download:`Standard Installation Image <https://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_V12.x86_64-12.0.2.iso>`
    The 'standard' version is for installation into a system with a single drive. It's the idea option if you have a Hardware RAID, a Network or SAN you boot from, or are using a VM Guest for install. It's also the least involved to setup since it lacks the MD software RAID.
