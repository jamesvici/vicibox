ViciBox supports installation from a USB flash drive as well as a CD/DVD drive. This is accomplished through a hybrid ISO file that can be used for either media type. A simple ISO to USB writer like ImageUSB or Rufus can be used to create the installation thumb drive. There are two different installation media currently available for ViciBox.
