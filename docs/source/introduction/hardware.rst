   The recommendations and suggestions in this section are based on a relatively conservative outbound dialing ratio. This is assumed to be an outbound dial ratio of 5:1 for 25 agents. Actual capacity may vary depending upon dialing levels, lead quality, areas being called, time of day, etc. These recommendations should be viewed more as a starting point for your own installs.
