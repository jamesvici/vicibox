Bug fixes are rolled up into later realeases. So a ViciBox v.12.0.1 system does not need any of the updates listed for ViciBox v.12.0.0. You only need to apply updates that are equal to or greater then your ViciBox install media version.

The version of ViciBox used to install the server is shown just above the **#** command prompt after logging in as ``root``, I.E. **- ViciBox v.12.0.1 250118**. Most of the fixes are done through the CLI by logging in as the root user. This can be done over SSH or through a directly attached keyboard and monitor.

As a general rule the fixes are mainly for issues that can't reasonably be applied through a standard package update. The following sections are separated by ViciBox version and then the specific issue.
