Bug Fixes
*********
   Bug fixes, patch notes, errata, and other important ViciBox related issues will eventually be listed here. As a general rule, this section will only contain things if the fix can't be reasonably applied through a package update.

   The following sections are separated by ViciBox version as well as the issue that applies to that version. For instance the **11.0.0 AGI module** bugfix section would only apply to ViciBox v.11.0.0. The fix contained in that section should not be applied to a newer version of ViciBox like v.11.0.1, etc.
