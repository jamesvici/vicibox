Bug Fixes
*********
   Bug fixes are rolled up into later realeases. Therefore any fixes listed for ViciBox v.11.0.1 should not be applied to an older v.11.0.0 install as those fixes have already been applied. In comparison, a ViciBox v.11.0.0 system should get all fixes applied to it as none of those fixes has been applied.
   
   The version of ViciBox used to install the server is shown just above the **#** command prompt after logging in as ``root``, I.E. **- ViciBox v.11.0.1 230806**. 

   As a general rule the fixes are mainly for issues that can't reasonably be applied through a standard package update. The following sections are separated by ViciBox version and then the specific issue.
