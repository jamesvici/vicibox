`MD RAID1 Installation Image <http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v10.x86_64-10.0.2-md.iso>`_:
The 'MD' or MultiDevice media installs in a software RAID-1. This allows two drives to be used for failure redundancy. This does require two drives to be present in the system. For best results the two drives should be a matched pair. If one drive is slightly smaller it should be installed as the first drive in the system.
