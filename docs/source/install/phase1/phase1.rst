=======
Phase 1
=======

The installation of ViciBox is broken up into two phases. Phase 1 is the installation of the ViciBox distribution onto the server. This is a destructive process and will erase any previously existing data on the selected drive. Now is the time to create backups and verify they work if this is an upgrade from a previous version of ViciBox.
