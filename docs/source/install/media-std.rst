`Standard Installation Image <http://download.vicidial.com/iso/vicibox/server/ViciBox_v10.x86_64-10.0.2.iso>`_:
The 'standard' version is for installation into a system with a single drive. If you have a hardware RAID card then this is the image to use. When in doubt this is likely the easiest option to install.
